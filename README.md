# Thoughts

- 3 songs, each record is a different track, completing does the bass drop
- How do I set the vr camera position optimally?
- The paws are the wrong orientation when using hands and not controllers
- Progress Labels need to be smarter about transparency and order
- Crowd needs to be better (more cat model, arms, better saving/playing anims)
- Redo the progress and solved meshes (Make it obvious you need 3 patterns for the "good" ending)
- Put the text into one label on the screen, and make the leds under it go to that length
    - Make the current solved light flash
    - Put a big ol button under glass with the solved lights
