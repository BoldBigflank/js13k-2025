# Thoughts

- The paws are the wrong orientation when using hands and not controllers
- Progress display needs to be more flashy
- Put a big ol Horns button under glass with the solved lights
- Vinyl Highlight behavior/mesh

- SplashEvent should take in a string (to let the fish show the number)
- FishJuggledEvent should be the current fish's shot value
