# Thoughts

- The paws are the wrong orientation when using hands and not controllers
- 3 songs, each record is a different track, completing does the bass drop
- Redo the solved meshes (Make it obvious you need 3 patterns for the "good" ending)
- Progress display needs to be more flashy
- Put a big ol Horns button under glass with the solved lights
- Intro text bubbles
- Vinyl Highlight behavior/mesh
