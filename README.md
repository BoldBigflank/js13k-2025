# Thoughts

- 3 songs, each record is a different track, completing does the bass drop
- The paws are the wrong orientation when using hands and not controllers
- Crowd needs to be better (more cat model, arms, better saving/playing anims)
- Redo the solved meshes (Make it obvious you need 3 patterns for the "good" ending)
- Make the current solved led light flash
- Put a big ol Horns button under glass with the solved lights
